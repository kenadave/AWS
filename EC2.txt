Dedicated Instances:
    It is tied to one AWS account. The underlying hardware is dedicated to the AWS account.
    The hardware wont be shared with any other AWS customers
    It does not have visibility to core, sockets, affinity
    When start / stop the hardware can be changed
Dedicated hosts:
    The underlying hardware can be shared within the AWS accounts of a AWS Organization
    More useful for bring-your-own-licence ( BYOL ) software requirements
    It has more visibility to core, sockets, affinity
    When start / stop the hardware remains same or can be selected


CPU Socket is the connector on server's motherboard to insert the CPU. There can be multiple sockets.
Every CPU has cores. Each core can have multiple threads.

If a process is running on one socket, there will be cache stored in it. If the scheduler transfers that process to another socket that cache is wasted and new fetch is happened on another socket. This is waste of time and memory. 

Modern CPUs have multi-level caches ( L1, L2, L3 ) which is faster than RAM. 

Affinity is pinning the process to the socket
