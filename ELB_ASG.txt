Vertical Scalability: non-distributed system such as database.
Horizontal Scalability: implies distributed systems
  Auto Scaling Group
  Load Balancer
High Availability:
  Auto Scaling Group multi AZ
  Load Balancer multi AZ

Scalability : out/in or up/down
Elasticity : Auto-scaling. ELB is used for this.


TCP : Transmission Control Protocol ( layer 4 )
HTTP : Hypertext Transfer Protocol ( layer 7 )
HTTP rides on TCP. First TCP is made then HTTP requests

GENEVE : Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation

Application Load Balancer : for HTTP/S
Network Load Balancer : for TCP
Gateway Load Balancer : for GENEVE ( layer 3 )

It can be like once user hits the web application, it hits to the ALB, which is transferred to GLB for security. The 3rd party virtualization encapsulation is done and sent back to GLB. The request then reaches to the application. The application internally can connect with TCP for high performance in which NLB comes.

Parameters for LB
Minimum size : 
Actual size :
Maximum size :

During ASG creation different AZs from a VPC can be selected. Also load balancer is selected. 
ALB can be setup manually by adding instances. To automate it use ASG. For ASG, launch template also can be used.

Auto scaling strategies:
1) Simple/step
2) Target
3) Predictive
4) Scheduled
