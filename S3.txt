 - Objects have a key which is full path
 - The buckets are regional level but S3 service is global level

Security :-
   User Based
   Resource Based

IAM policy ALLOW OR Bucket policy ALLOW and there is no explicit DENY

JSON based policy :
     Resources : on which it should apply
     Effect : Allow or Deny
     Actions : API on which Effect will be applied
     Principal : account or user on which policy will be applied

Policies can be used to
       force objects to be encrypted at upload
       grant access to another account

S3 Replication:
     Can be CRR or SRR ( same or cross )
     Async
     Versions need to be enabled in both source and destination buckets, buckets can be in different accounts
     Use cases:
         compliance
         lower latency access
         replication across accounts
     Objects uploaded before setup wont be copied automatically. Different batch operation is required for this.
     SRR use case:
         consolidate the all types of logs from different places to one destination bucket.
         replicate prod data to test env

Snowball :
    Storage optimized and Compute optimized
