Connect from local for federated user:
    The credentials file will be downloaded when logged in. Install AWS CLI and open cmd where aws is present. 
    Use those Access Secret Key and Secret Key ID in aws configure command. 

A Cloud Practitioner would like to get operational insights of its resources to quickly identify any issues that might impact applications using those resources. Which AWS service can help with this task?
AWS Trusted Advisor : cant be correct answer as it does not give real time insights. It is about account level recommendations. The question is not about preventive static checks.
AWS Health Dashboard : Does not give resource based insights.
If forcasting against Budget: AWS Budget
If forcasting against based on trends : AWS Cost Explorer

Track activity for governance, compliance and auditing : Cloudtrail

hardware device for USB port : U2F security key

multi-region and multi-active database : dynamodb with global tables

cloudwatch can be used for centralize logging of on-prem & cloud. Cloudwatch Agent can help in that. No integration is available for AWS Lambda on on-premisis.

For prohibited usage AUP ( Acceptable Use Policy )

For web / mobile apps sign in : AWS Cognito
For SSO : AWS IAM Identity Center

For identifying under-utilized EC2 instances : 
Trust Advisor
Cost Explorer
AWS Cost and Usage Report wont help here. It gives raw data and Athena is required for fetching details based on queries.

AMI should be in the same EC2 region. AMI region affects the launch eligibility but not the runtime performance.

EBS is the block storage directly connected with EC2 so while optimizing it matters. While EFS, S3 are shared storage so Compute optimizer dont consider them
Compute Optimizer considers EC2, ASG, Lambda too

model resources is possible in Cloudformation and CDK but not in Elastic Beanstalk. EBS generates resources automatically. 

EBS and instance store are block level storage.
S3 is object level
block level means like harddrive, raw data
object level means like data on web which can be accessed through API

X-Ray is used for debugging and tracing



For ensuring right amount of instances : ASG
Load balancer only transfers the traffic

For modeling resources : Beanstalk is not the correct option. modeling resources means you create resources. While Beanstalk creates automatically

AWS Organization can be used to create aws account automatically through createAccount API

Availability means the system is available to use (Multi AZ deployment)
Realiability means while using the system it does not fail in between (backups)
Scalability (Read replica)
Regional failover (Cross region Read replica)

for regional failover read replicas are helpful as we have more time to do manual steps to make the system up
for availability they are not as it should be failover automatically, without much time.

For chef/puppet automation, OpsWorks is used.

if a startup needs to quickly deploy a popular technology : AWS Partner Solutions ( not Code Deploy )

AWS Edge location : for content delivery and not for game delivery. game require hosts and 2-way communication. it also requires compute and storage near to the user.
AWS Local Zones : for low latency in real time applications like gaming. Above benefits included.

Hardware Software Connectivity solutions : APN Technology Partner
Professional services : APN Consulting Partner

Sharing files across many ec2 instances : EFS
EFS is a shared drive
EBS is attached 1:1
S3 is not a file storage
Instance store is ephemeral


############################ PRACTICE TEST 1 ############################
Security Group = Secutiry Guard = Only allow people in the list and dont do anything for others
They work for a place (instance)

NAT lets you call out but blocks call in

We can choose our instance type and size for RDS

same region:
        ec2 to s3 => free (data into)
        s3 to ec2 => chargable (data out)

EBS : 
    same AZ one instance
EFS :
    multi AZ multi instances


• CloudFront: 400+ edge locations = bigger attack surface
• Route 53: DNS attacks can take down entire domains
• Global Accelerator: Entry point to AWS global network

Because of above, Sheild Advanced should be considered for above services
