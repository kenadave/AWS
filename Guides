A Cloud Practitioner would like to get operational insights of its resources to quickly identify any issues that might impact applications using those resources. Which AWS service can help with this task?
AWS Trusted Advisor : cant be correct answer as it does not give real time insights. It is about account level recommendations. The question is not about preventive static checks.
AWS Health Dashboard : Does not give resource based insights.
If forcasting against Budget: AWS Budget
If forcasting against based on trends : AWS Cost Explorer

Track activity for governance, compliance and auditing : Cloudtrail

hardware device for USB port : U2F security key

multi-region and multi-active database : dynamodb with global tables

cloudwatch can be used for centralize logging of on-prem & cloud. Cloudwatch Agent can help in that. No integration is available for AWS Lambda on on-premisis.

For prohibited usage AUP ( Acceptable Use Policy )

For web / mobile apps sign in : AWS Cognito
For SSO : AWS IAM Identity Center

For identifying under-utilized EC2 instances : 
Trust Advisor
Cost Explorer
AWS Cost and Usage Report wont help here. It gives raw data and Athena is required for fetching details based on queries.

AMI should be in the same EC2 region. AMI region affects the launch eligibility but not the runtime performance.

EBS is the block storage directly connected with EC2 so while optimizing it matters. While EFS, S3 are shared storage so Compute optimizer dont consider them
Compute Optimizer considers EC2, ASG, Lambda too
