EBS:

Attach network storage ( Elastic Block Store ) to EC2, to retain data even after termination.
There is an attribute of "Delete on Termination". Ticked by-default for the root volume and not for the EBS
1 EBS to 1 EC2 ( on CCP level )
Bound to one AZ
Attached through network, so latency
If need to move across AZ, use snapshots

Snapshot features:
  Recyclebin & retention
  Move to archive tier, 75% cheaper but 24 to 72 hours to get the data restored
  (Just for Knowledge) :
      Compressed and de-deduplicated. So it need to uncompress and reassemble while retriving
      The underlying hardware is slower. Used for high capacity not high throughput
      Metadata storage in faster accessible one
      Long-term storage in Tape or HDD
      Read and write sequentially
      Erasure coding : data is broken into fragments and parity bits are generated. Extreme durability and less storage overhead

AMI ( Amazon Machine Image ):
  Pre-packaged so when instance launched using it, it does not take much time in boot-up

EC2 Image builder ( Automates the creating, maintain, validate and test EC2 AMIs ) :
  Create Builder EC2 Instance
  Create New AMI
  Test EC2 Instance
  Distribute the AMIs across the regions
