EBS:

Attach network storage ( Elastic Block Store ) to EC2, to retain data even after termination.
There is an attribute of "Delete on Termination". Ticked by-default for the root volume and not for the EBS
1 EBS to 1 EC2 ( on CCP level )
Bound to one AZ
Attached through network, so latency
If need to move across AZ, use snapshots

Snapshot features:
  Recyclebin & retention
  Move to archive tier, 75% cheaper but 24 to 72 hours to get the data restored
