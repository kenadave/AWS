1) No. When using public IP addresses, all communication between instances and services hosted in AWS use AWS's private network. Packets that originate from the AWS network with a destination on the AWS network stay on the AWS global network, except traffic to or from AWS China Regions.

* 2) Interface type endpoints provide private connectivity to services powered by PrivateLink, being AWS services, your own services or SaaS solutions, and supports connectivity over Direct Connect.
 
3) Default VPCs are assigned a CIDR range of 172.31.0.0/16. Default subnets within a default VPC are assigned /20 netblocks within the VPC CIDR range. 

4) Amazon VPC IP Address Manager (IPAM) is a managed service that makes it easier for you to plan, track, and monitor IP addresses for your AWS workloads.

5) VPC Flow Logs vs Traffic Mirroring
Amazon VPC flow logs allow customers to collect, store, and analyze network flow logs. The information captured in flow logs includes information about allowed and denied traffic, source and destination IP addresses, ports, protocol number, packet and byte counts, and an action (accept or reject). You can use this feature to troubleshoot connectivity and security issues and to make sure that the network access rules are working as expected.

Amazon VPC traffic mirroring, provides deeper insight into network traffic by allowing you to analyze actual traffic content, including payload, and is targeted for use-cases when you need to analyze the actual packets to determine the root cause a performance issue, reverse-engineer a sophisticated network attack, or detect and stop insider abuse or compromised workloads.
