RDS & Aurora

Read Replicas and Multi AZ

15 Read replicas
but only 1 Failover multi AZ (both read and write)
Multi region read replica :
        DR
        local performance for global read

ElastiCache : in-memory database
              AWS managed Redis or memcached

DynamoDB : replication across 3 AZ
           NoSQL database
           *serverless - milisecond latency*
DAX : in-memory cache for DynamoDB
    write also goes through DAX, TTL config, removing cold data from DAX, LRU eviction will prevent memory overhead
    10X performance improvement

Multi AZ => High Availability
Read Replicas => Scalability
