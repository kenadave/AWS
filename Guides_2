########################################### Practice Test 3 ###########################################

1) EC2 instances can access files on an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system across 
many Availability Zones (AZ), Regions and VPCs

2) Global in minutes means primary is "Global" and not "minutes". QUICK Innovations and keep things moving are part of "Agility".

3) Tags must be enabled before reports. If they are enabled by default then report will be clumsy with too much of details.
For each resource each tag must be unique and each tag can have only one value
env tag cant have values as dev and prod

4) Tags cant help in getting seperate invoices. May help in logically seperate invoices. But for physically seperate invoices,
one should have different AWS accounts.

5) AWS Sheild Advanced is not included in any support plans. It saves from the cost incurred due to DDoS attack. Scaling will 
happen and that will cause the money
