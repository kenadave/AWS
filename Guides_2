########################################### Practice Test 3 ###########################################

1) EC2 instances can access files on an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system across 
many Availability Zones (AZ), Regions and VPCs

2) Global in minutes means primary is "Global" and not "minutes". QUICK Innovations and keep things moving are part of "Agility".

3) Tags must be enabled before reports. If they are enabled by default then report will be clumsy with too much of details.
For each resource each tag must be unique and each tag can have only one value
env tag cant have values as dev and prod

4) Tags cant help in getting seperate invoices. May help in logically seperate invoices. But for physically seperate invoices,
one should have different AWS accounts.

5) AWS Sheild Advanced is not included in any support plans. It saves from the cost incurred due to DDoS attack. Scaling will 
happen and that will cause the money

6) Glue is preparing data
EME - Hadoop - Does analytics on prepared data

7) API Access is cloudtrail and not cloudwatch

8) Enhanced technical support starts with Business 

Enhanced technical support by associates -=> Developer
by Engineers => Business

9) Audit requests made to S3 -> S3 Access logs

10) Route 53 doesn't do IP Routing. It does Domain Registration, and health checks

11) Datasync :- automated data from on-prem to aws with incremental backup
Storage Gateway :- data stored on cloud, access locally with low latency

12) FIS :- Chaos Engineering 

13) VGW and CGW

14) IPOS and volume types


15) EC2 from one region to another: AMI

16) Comprehensive means detailed

17) simplest different invoices means logically and not strictly physically 


18) TCO estimate means comparison of on-premises and AWS costs. Consider aspects which should be taken into consider

19)
