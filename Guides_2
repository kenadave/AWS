########################################### Practice Test 3 ###########################################

1) EC2 instances can access files on an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system across 
many Availability Zones (AZ), Regions and VPCs

2) Global in minutes means primary is "Global" and not "minutes". QUICK Innovations and keep things moving are part of "Agility".

3) Tags must be enabled before reports. If they are enabled by default then report will be clumsy with too much of details.
For each resource each tag must be unique and each tag can have only one value
env tag cant have values as dev and prod

4) Tags cant help in getting seperate invoices. May help in logically seperate invoices. But for physically seperate invoices,
one should have different AWS accounts.

5) AWS Sheild Advanced is not included in any support plans. It saves from the cost incurred due to DDoS attack. Scaling will 
happen and that will cause the money

6) Glue is preparing data
EME - Hadoop - Does analytics on prepared data

7) API Access is cloudtrail and not cloudwatch

8) Enhanced technical support starts with Business 

Enhanced technical support by associates -=> Developer
by Engineers => Business

9) Audit requests made to S3 -> S3 Access logs

10) Route 53 doesn't do IP Routing. It does Domain Registration, and health checks

11) Datasync :- automated data from on-prem to aws with incremental backup
Storage Gateway :- data stored on cloud, access locally with low latency

12) FIS :- Chaos Engineering 

13) VGW and CGW

14) IPOS and volume types


15) EC2 from one region to another: AMI

16) Comprehensive means detailed

17) simplest different invoices means logically and not strictly physically 


18) TCO estimate means comparison of on-premises and AWS costs. Consider aspects which should be taken into consider

19) WAF - CALA
cloudFront
Api gateway
load balancer
AppSync


20) AWS Owned
AWS managed
Customer managed

21) EFS is tied to VPC. So it's not global
It will be difficult for consistency and low-latency

22) Workspaces : DaaS
Appstream 2.0 : stream web app from AWS to a web browser 

23) Ultra low latency at edge locations through mobile networks : Wavelengths 

Snowball edge is kind of offline

24) Savings plans
Compute: 66%, ec2-lambda-fargate
EC2 instance: 72%
SageMaker:64%

25) Threat, unauthorised, malicious: GuardDuty - outside guard

Inspector: inside vulnerabilities 

26) ec2 image builder
